## Version 2.1.0 *(2022-03-01)* 🚀

* 🐞 Fixed [#74](https://github.com/ImaginativeShohag/Why-Not-Image-Carousel/issues/74):
  Changing `infiniteCarousel` attribute now will call `initAdapter()`.

*Note:* Before changing the `infiniteCarousel`, it is better to clear the data-set, then change the
`infiniteCarousel` attribute and finally set the data. Changing the `infiniteCarousel` with existing
data can create undesirable issues.

Example code:

```kotlin
// Step 1: Clear existing data
carousel.setData(emptyList())

// Step 2: Change infiniteCarousel
carousel.infiniteCarousel = true // or false

// Step 3: Finally, set data
carousel.setData(itemList) // itemList is List<CarouselItem>
```

* ⬆ Dependencies upgraded to the latest version.
* 🆕 Some instrumented tests were added.

## Version 2.0.6 *(2022-01-11)*

* 🐞 Fixed [#72](https://github.com/ImaginativeShohag/Why-Not-Image-Carousel/issues/72): Indicator
  will now indicate first item after data replace.
* ⬆ Updated deprecated lifecycle code.
* ⬆ Kotlin and other libs upgraded to the latest version.

## Version 2.0.5 *(2021-09-30)*

* 🐞 Fixed [#50](https://github.com/ImaginativeShohag/Why-Not-Image-Carousel/issues/50): Fixed a
  crash when dataset changed.
* 🐞 Fixed some bugs related to data insert.
* ⬆ Kotlin and other libs upgraded to the latest version.

## Version 2.0.4 *(2021-08-08)*

* 🐞
  Fixed [#43](https://github.com/ImaginativeShohag/Why-Not-Image-Carousel/issues/43): `currentPosition`
  will now give real data position. For virtual data position in `infiniteCarousel`
  use `currentVirtualPosition`.
* 🐞 Fixed [#45](https://github.com/ImaginativeShohag/Why-Not-Image-Carousel/issues/45): `autoPlay`
  will now work after slide.

## Version 2.0.3 *(2021-07-25)*

* 🐞 Fixed: wrong `position` value in `onScrollStateChanged` listener.

## Version 2.0.2 *(2021-05-31)*

* 🆕 `registerLifecycle(lifecycleOwner: LifecycleOwner)` method added.
* 🛠️ Java sample converted into a `Fragment` example.

## Version 2.0.0, 2.0.1 *(2021-05-22)*

* 🆕 Previous boring custom layout system removed. And view-binding supported custom layout system
  added. See `CarouselListener` in the sample app for details. 🎉
* 🆕 The carousel is now supported Infinite ∞ looping (Infinite Carousel) 🥳! It's default now. You
  can disable it by setting `infiniteCarousel` to `false`.
* 🆕 Carousel now supports touch-to-pause auto-play. It is default now. You can disable it by
  setting `touchToPause` to `false`. 🎊
* 🆕 `carouselGravity` attribute added. So you can set carousel item view gravity `START` if you
  want.
* 🆕 Carousel padding attributes added. You can use `carouselPadding`, `carouselPaddingStart`
  , `carouselPaddingTop`, `carouselPaddingEnd`, and `carouselPaddingBottom` to set carousel padding.
* 🆕 The `ImageCarousel` is now a lifecycle component. You can register any lifecycle
  with `registerLifecycle()` method. It is recommended if you enable `autoPlay`
  and `infiniteCarousel`. So that when the application is in the pause state, the carousel will be
  paused and resumed on the app resume. It is also used to correctly initialize the infinite
  carousel when the app is in the background.
* 🆕 You can now use `setData()` to set `CarouselItem` list. And `addData()` to add single or
  multiple items to the carousel. If you set/add data only once, then you can continue
  using `addData()` method.
* 🆕 You can now get the carousel items using `getData()` method.
* 🆕 Sample app re-designed. Various use cases and inspiring 💡 examples are added. 😎
* ⚠️ `OnItemClickListener` renamed to `CarouselListener` and two new method (`onCreateViewHolder()`
  and `onBindViewHolder()`) added for the latest custom view feature. `setOnItemClickListener()`
  also renamed to `setCarouselListener()`.
* ⚠️ `CarouselListener` (previously `OnItemClickListener`) package changed
  from `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel`
  to `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel.listener`.
* ⚠️ `CarouselItem` package changed from `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel`
  to `org.imaginativeworld.whynotimagecarousel.model`.
* ️🛠 New parameters `position` and `carouselItem` add to `onScrolled` method
  in  `CarouselOnScrollListener`.
* 🛠️ The default carousel background changed to transparent. You can always change the background
  of the carousel using `carouselBackground`. The previous value was `#333333`.
* 🛠️ Left and right navigation default button icon replaced with a rounded chevron icon.

## Version 1.3.0 *(2021-03-25)*

Header field is added to the `CarouselItem`.

Examples:

```kotlin
// Kotlin
val headers = mutableMapOf<String, String>()
headers["header_key"] = "header_value"

val carouselItem1 = CarouselItem(
    imageUrl = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549577434-d7615fd4ceac?w=1080",
    caption = "Photo by Jeremy Bishop on Unsplash",
  headers = headers
)
val carouselItem2 = CarouselItem(
  imageUrl = "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549577434-d7615fd4ceac?w=1080",
  headers = headers
)
```

```java
// Java
Map<String, String> headers=new HashMap<>();
        headers.put("header_key","header_value");

        CarouselItem carouselItem1=new CarouselItem(
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549577434-d7615fd4ceac?w=1080",
        "Photo by Jeremy Bishop on Unsplash",
        headers
        );

        CarouselItem carouselItem2=new CarouselItem(
        "https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1549577434-d7615fd4ceac?w=1080",
        headers
        );
